    "is a powerful tool for performing complex string matching based on simple or intricate patterns. It allows fo finding and retrieving patterns or replacing matching patterns in a string with another pattern. RegEx was invented by Steohen Cole Kleene in the 1950s and remains widely used today, especially for tasks involving string matching in text. It is fully integrated with most search engines and enables more robust searching capabilities. Data scientists, particulary those working with text, often rely on RegEx at various stages of their workflow, including data searching, data cleaning, and implementing machine learning models. It is an essential tool for ant researcher working with text-based data.\n",

    "In spaCy, RegEx can be utilized in different pipes, depending on the specific task at hand. It can be leveraged to identify entities or perform pattern matching, among other applications."
