    "+ spaCy serves as both an NLP framework and a system for constructing and executing intricate pipelines.\n",
    "+ A pipeline in spaCy is a series of pipes or actors that perform operations on data, either modifying it or extracting relevant information.\n",
    "+ Some pipes in the pipeline may rely on the output generated by preceding pipes, hile others can operata independently.\n",

    "+ In the described pipeline, an input sentence enters from the left.\n",
    "+ The pipeline consists of two activated pipes:\n",
    "    + An EntityRuler, whichj is a rule-based NER that identifies entities in the sentence.\n",
    "    + An EntityLinker pipe, which performs topoym resolution to determine the specific entity.\n",
    "+ After passing through these pipes, the sentence is outputted with annotations indicating the identified entities.\n",
    "+ The spaCy feature **doc.ents** can be used to extract the entities from the annotated sentence.\n",
    "+ In more sophisticated pipelines, spaCy utilizes a Tok2Vec input layer to vectorize the input sentence. This enables machine learning pipes to make predictions based on the vectorized representations."

They are designed to identify and extract specific combinations of tokens, based on criteria such as token attributes, POS tags, dependencies, and more. Matchers can be used to extract entites, noun phrases, verb phrases, or any other specific patterns of interest from the text. They provide a powerful tool for pattern-based information extraction and can be combined with other spaCy components to build complex NLP pipelines.

    "+ In most scenarios, utilizing an existing pre-trained spaCy model is sufficient.\n",
    "+ However, there are cases where an off-the-shelf model may not meet specific requirements or may perform certain tasks slowly.\n",
    "+ An example is sentence tokenization, particularly when dealing with a lengthy document containing a large number of sentences.\n",
    "+ Even with the small English model, processing a large number of sentences can be time-consuming.\n",
    "+ To address this, a blank English model can be created, and only the Sentencizer component needs to be added to it.\n",
