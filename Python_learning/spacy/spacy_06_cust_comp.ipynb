    "Custom components are user-defined pipeline components that can be added to the processing pipeline. These components allow you to extend the functionality of spaCy and perform additional processing or manipulation on the documents, tokens, or other linguistic elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom components are typically used to add new functionality that is not available out-of-the-bos in spaCy, such as custom entity recognition, custom rule-based matching, or any other specific processing or analysis task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a custom component in spaCy, you need to define a function or a class that takes a **Doc** object and modifies it in some way. This function or class should conform to the required signature and be registered as a pipeline component using the **nlp.add_pipe()** method."
