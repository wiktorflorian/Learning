    "The *n-gram** technique is a text analysis approach used in NLP to capture and represent the relationships between adjacent elements (such as words or characters) in a sequence of thext. A n-gram refers to a notigous sequence of n items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The n-gram technique involves breaking down a text into these n-grams, which can be unigrams (single itmes), bigrams (sequences of two item), trigrams (sequences of three items), or higher-order n-grams. By examining the frequency and co-occurrence of these n-grams. valuable insights can be derived about the language, patterns and structures within the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "N-grams are often used as features in various NLP tasks and machin learning models. For example, in sentiment analysis, n-gram can help capture important phrases or combinations of words that contribute to the overall sentiment expressed in a text. In language modeling, b-grams can be used to predict the likelihood of a particular word or sequence of words occuring based on the previous context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of the value of n in the n-gram technique depends on the specific task and the characteristics of the text data. Higher-order n-grams can capture more context but may result in larger feature space and increased computional complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the n-gram technique is a powerful tool in NLP for analyzing ad understanding the relationships between adjacent elements in a text, enabling a wide range of applications such as sentiment analysis language modeling, information retrieval, and text generation."
