    "**logging** module is part of the standard library and provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from application.

The **logging** module supports various handlers and formatters to customize the log output.\n",

We can define the logging configuration directly in code by providing a dictionary that specifies the handlers formatters, loggers, and their properties. The **dictConfig** method is useful when you want to programmatically configure logging withou relying on external configuration files.\n",
    "2. **fileConfig**: This method allows you to configure the logging system using an external configuration file. We can define the logging configuration in a separate file, typically using the INI or YAML format. The **fileConfig** method reads the configuration from the file and applies it to the loggin system. This approach is useful when you want to change the logging behavior without modifying the code, as you can easily modify the configuration file."
